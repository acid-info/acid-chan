acidchan PoC & MVP

<br/>

## How to build

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

<br/>

## Notes

- The current code is intended only for the MVP and is not suitable for production.

- The [original repository](https://github.com/plebbit/plebchan) uses an old-style Create React App (CRA) in JavaScript. The code generally needs refactoring in TypeScript.

- We are temporarily using [Commerce.js](https://commercejs.com/) as the backend to expedite the shipping of the MVP.
